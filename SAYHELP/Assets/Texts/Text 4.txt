The men and the woman were talking together loudly, even fiercely, 
and the ass was drawing his cart along the road without requiring 
assistance or direction. While there was a road he walked on it: 
when he might come to a cross road he would turn to the right: 
when a man said “whoh” he would stop: when he said “hike” he would go backwards, 
and when he said “yep” he would go on again. That was life, 
and if one questioned it, one was hit with a stick, or a boot, 
or a lump of rock: if one continued walking nothing happened, and that
was happiness.
